## WHY I BUILT IT THIS WAY

### Data Structure Choices

**Explain your design decisions:**
- When would you choose to use a mapping instead of an array in your smart contract? C
- How did you structure your state variables?
- What trade-offs did you consider?

[Write about your data structure choices]

### Security Measures

**What attacks did you protect against?**
- Reentrancy attacks?
- Access control vulnerabilities?
- Integer overflow/underflow?
- Front-running?

[Write about your security approach]
